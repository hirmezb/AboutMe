                <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>Hello, and welcome to my first ever website! My name is Benel, and I'm currently a student at
                        Boston University studying to get my Master of Science degree in Software Development. I'm not a
                        typical software developer in that I didn't always envision myself coding and developing
                        programs. Before I started pursuing this degree, I had no coding knowledge and didn't get my
                        first software development experience until I took my first course in this program. Before this,
                        I was very much interested in becoming a physician. I was a premed and got my BS in
                        pharmaceutical chemistry from UC Davis in 2019. After I graduated, I started teaching anatomy
                        lab (as a teaching assistant) to undergraduates at UC Davis. I really enjoyed teached,
                        especially when it was a subject I'm so passionate about. However, I needed a real career, so I
                        decided to use my degree and work at Genentech, a biotech company in the Bay in California. I
                        worked there for two years, and while I enjoyed what I did there, I felt i wasn't doing enough
                        to advance medical science (which had always been my dream). So after seeing my brother, Onel,
                        graduate from BU using the very same MS program, I decided to pursue it as well, knowing that
                        there was a lot of potential to advance medicine using software in the future. So, here I am
                        now, eager to learn more and hope to be able to use my passion for learning alongside my love of
                        medicine and software development to create new ways to diagnose patients and produce more
                        patient-specific treatments and drugs.</p>

                    <p>So where does my passion for medicine come from? Well, I'd have to go back to my childhood. I was
                        born and raised in Baghdad, Iraq and lived there until 2005. That does unfortunately mean I
                        experienced the horrors of the 2003 Iraq War. I saw what war does to people: fear, lack of
                        medicine and medical care, loss, and economic collapse. I witnessed so many children my age and
                        even younger who had to work in order to feed their younger siblings due to the war bringing
                        massive inflation with it. I've seen people get disfigured or killed from explosions and
                        shootings. Worst of all was the fact that medicine was scarce, so even those who could've been
                        saved, sadly lost their lives.</p>

                    <p>I had a very intimate view of this as my father was a physician
                        and so we had a lot of patients come to our house to be seen by him since medical care outside
                        became so expensive and out of reach of the majority. Growing up and seeing that, as a child who
                        was fortunate enough to keep their house and not have to work, I wished there was something I
                        could to help. That want to help people was etched into my brain, and every type of job I've
                        done since had a measure of that. That's also why I am so passionate about medicine; seeing
                        people die from easily treatable diseases, which my sister and I came close to ourselves, I
                        never wanted to see another human being suffer like that. Everyone has the right to have access
                        to affordable medicine. I believe that with enough effort put in, I can one day develop a
                        program that makes drug research/manufacturing much cheaper which would in turn produce more
                        affordable medication for people across the world.</p>
