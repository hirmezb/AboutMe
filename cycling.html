                <h2>Why I Enjoy Cycling So Much?</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>I started cycling daily while I was an undergraduate student at UC Davis, one of the most bike
                        friendly campuses.
                        UCD has the 10th largest campus in the US so riding a bike was almost a necessity to make it to
                        classes on time.
                        Over time, cycling switched from being a necessary chore to an amazing hobby. I would go on late
                        night rides on
                        campus while listening to music or just to try to relax, especially during finals week. Being at
                        Davis (the city),
                        I was forced to become a better cyclist having to deal with so many cars on the road; this made
                        me a more confident
                        biker and in turn, made me fall in love with cycling even more. In my fourth year at Davis, I
                        made a new friend from
                        my anatomy course, and he happened to be on the cycling team. We started going out biking
                        together, only short distances
                        at first (5-10 miles) and then slowly increased it to where we would cycle for 50-60 miles a
                        ride without getting
                        too tired. This gave me the courage to want to try completing a century ride (100 mile ride
                        nonstop).
                        I followed an 8 week plan to make sure I was in good enough shape to be able to do it without
                        injuring myself.
                        After the 8 weeks were up, my friend and I cycled the 100 mile trip together, riding up from
                        Davis to
                        Lake Berryessa, Napa vineyards, and lakes a long the way. This was definitely the most
                        challenging physical act
                        I've done at that point.</p>

                    <p>After moving back home after school ended, I treated myself to a Specialized Rouabix bike, which
                        was far more
                        comfortable than the one I used for the century ride, a 2018 Specialized Tarmac. This made it
                        easier for me to
                        continue my long distance rides at home. One of the things I love most about riding is that I
                        can go explore
                        new roads and see new things while I keep my camera in my backpack. This helps me combine both
                        passions into one,
                        and there is nothing more fun than getting to take photos of a new scene after a long bike ride.
