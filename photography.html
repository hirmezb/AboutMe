                <h2>Why Photography?</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>I grew up with a dad and a grandpa that loved photography. I just picked up my dad's camera and
                        started snapping
                        pictures probably when I was 4 or 5 years old; Of course, they were horrible (as expected haha),
                        but they still
                        remain today. I think that's why I enjoy photography so much: it captures a fond memory and
                        makes it last a
                        lifetime and some more. I never get tired of seeing old family photos, both from when I was a
                        kid to well before
                        I was born. It feels weird that you're able to look into the lives of people who might've passed
                        a long time ago
                        and still picture them clearly.</p>

                    <p> After growing up and getting more experience, I went from using a simple Fujifilm snap-and-shoot
                        to a Sony A7RIII DSLR.
                        I mostly do landscape photography now, but I also like portrait and urban photography. I began
                        to edit my own photos using
                        Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop. Recently, I bought a printer to print out our photos at home (my
                        dad, brother, and
                        I). This gives it even more meaning now: the feeling of physically holding something in your
                        hands that you created is just
                        amazing!! I'll show you a list of the equipment I use from beginning to end, but you really
                        don't need all that; just some
                        passion and the will to go out and take photos. I like to go into a camera store, Mike's Camera
                        usually, to get all my shooting gear
                        (link down below). To see some of the photos I've taken over the years, head over to the
                        gallery.
