        <h2>What Games Do I Play?</h2>
        <article>
          <p>I've been gaming for as long as I can remember, since I got an Atari as a birthday present
            (makes me feel old since a lot of people won't even recognize that name lol). Gaming helps me escape into a
            different world. As someone who has moved around a lot, this is one of the best ways for me to keep in touch
            with
            old friends. I play all sorts of video games: First-person shooters, MMOs, survival, horror, etc,; some I've
            discovered myself
            while others were introduced to me by friends. Press the button below to view a table containing some of the
            games I play.</p>
